Noted that the classification is based on either nucleus or mitochondrial morphology to obtain time series classification. After CNN was trained, we applied LIME and SHAP algorithm to investigate the attention of the trained neural network. This is a pipeline to implement reliable classification algorithm with cell images.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Text Summary System</title><link>https://villahsu.github.io/project/textsummary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://villahsu.github.io/project/textsummary/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project implemented the deep learning tech in natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation. First, the system will read a article through the camera, and then the system will try to summarize the article into the short text that represents the whole article. Finally, the system will translate the text into the audio.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eye Controlled Robotic Arm</title><link>https://villahsu.github.io/project/robotic-arm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://villahsu.github.io/project/robotic-arm/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project used electrooculography (EOG) as the signal to control robotic arm. By detecting 6 different signal changes, we aimed to make the robotic arm finish 6 movements (left-right, up-down, grab-release).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intelligent Trash Can</title><link>https://villahsu.github.io/project/trashcan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://villahsu.github.io/project/trashcan/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project implemented the motion detection tech to check whether there is a person or not, and if there is someone approaching, the trash can will automatcially open the cap. In addition, to avoid the situation of over-capacity, we also implemented capacity detection inside the can. Finally, to help garbage truck track the capacity of the public trash can, we combined the system with the cloud service, creating an online trash map.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
