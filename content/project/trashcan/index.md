This project implemented the motion detection tech to check whether there is a person or not, and if there is someone approaching, the trash can will automatcially open the cap. In addition, to avoid the situation of over-capacity, we also implemented capacity detection inside the can. Finally, to help garbage truck track the capacity of the public trash can, we combined the system with the cloud service, creating an online trash map.
