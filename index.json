Based on a CNN-like U-Net architecture, such a model can effectively predict subcellular structures from transmitted light (TL) images after learning the relationships between TL images and fluorescent-labeled images. In this paper, we focused on building corresponding models of subcellular mitochondrial structures using the CNN method and compared the prediction results derived from confocal microscopic, Airyscan microscopic, z-stack, and time-series images. With multi-model combined prediction, it is possible to generate integrated images using only TL inputs, which reduces the time required for sample preparation and increases the temporal resolution. This enables visualization, measurement, and understanding of the morphology and dynamics of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA.","tags":["Mitochondria Structure","Deep Learning","3D Fluorescence Image"],"title":"Convolutional neural networks predict mitochondrial structures from label-free microscopy images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chan-Min Hsu","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Among different applications, ‚ÄúFace Changing‚Äù is one of the hottest topics, but most of such technologies are not as good as we thought. Also, difficulty to implement is another issue that results in unpredictable outcomes. In this project, our goal is to improve the similarity and generalizability of face changing by adjusting existing algorithms, making the whole process much easier to handle. As an ultimate goal, we hope to get a better output compared with original image. First, we have observed that the original algorithms only allow similar face angle to get somewhat good result. As a result, we try to focus on this point. However, we encounter some difficulties. Second, although the original two pictures have similar face angle, it still has some combination problems.","tags":["Deep Learning","Face Changing"],"title":"FASTER FACE CHANGING TECH","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project used convolutional neural network to classify mitotic stages via microscopic imaging.
